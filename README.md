# Plugin Development Boilerplate for WordPress

![License](https://img.shields.io/github/license/mypreview/wp-plugin-boilerplate)

Modern WordPress plugins are tough to setup. Either you buy into a framework, fork a boilerplate, or set things up yourself. 

Aiming to fill this void, this minimalistic boilerplate is a tool that abstracts all complex configurations needed for both server and client-side development into a single dependency--giving you the backbone developer experience of the [official WordPress scaffolding package](https://developer.wordpress.org/block-editor/reference-guides/packages/packages-create-block/) along with the extendibility and modularity of modern web technics and leaving the rest of your plugin's architectural decisions about Gutenberg block, post-type registration, and data fetching up to you.
